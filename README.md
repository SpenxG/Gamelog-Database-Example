# Gamelog-Database-Example
A final project to develop a website with user interfaces and database examples.

Features included: 
  - A navbar
  - The general CSS of the website
  - Pages that allow new user access and search functions; Queries that call game data to be formatted
    - Game list

- The registration page layout
  - Using a query to insert user info into the database
- The login page layout
  - Using a query to verify user info to allow a session login
